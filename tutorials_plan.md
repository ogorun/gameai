# Tutorial plan

1. Quick intorduction. Restrictions. Minimax search. Game/Agent/TicTacToe + MinimaxSearch
2. Estimation strategy: human/100 games (time, w/l/d) vs RandomAgent, itself and previous best. RandomAgent. Scripts for generic agent-human test and n games test. First move role (time comparison for )
3. Minimax with alpha-beta idea. DepthSensitiveMinimaxAgent. MinimaxWithAlphaBetaAgent
4. MCTSAgent. DepthSensitiveMCTSAgent. SingleTreeDepthSensitiveMCSTAgent.
5. Win loose check. Decorators need. WinLoose decorator and changes in MinimaxWithAlphaBeta and MCST. Pay attention to generic evaluation script.
6. Heuristic evaluation. Heuristic evaluation for TicTacToe (rule-based overview). Unit tests. Implementation changees for MinimaxWithAlphaBeta and MCST.
7. Chess implementation with ready package. Apply existing agents. Add evaluation with ready engines with third-party agents with levels.
8. Deepening. Moves number limited. Time limited. Decorator.
9. Open book usage. Decorator
10. Transposition tables


10. Conclusion. Systematisation.
